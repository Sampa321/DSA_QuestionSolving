/*
Given an array arr[] consisting of n distinct integers, find the maximum count of integers that are binary searchable in the given array. Binary searchable elements are determined using the standard Binary Search implementation described below.

Initially l is 0 and r is size of array - 1
while(l <= r), compute mid as floor of (l + r)/2 and compare with mid.
If the target element is same as mid, return true. Else if mid is smaller, change l = mid + 1, else change r = mid - 1.
For example:

In arr[] = [2, 1, 3, 4, 6, 5], the element 5 is not binary searchable. During Binary Search, the search eventually reaches the subarray containing 6, and since 6 > 5, the search moves left (r = mid - 1), causing the element 5 to be skipped.
In arr[] = [2, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6], the element 5 is binary searchable because the standard Binary Search process eventually reaches and finds 5.
Examples:

Input: arr[] = [1, 3, 2]
Output: 2
Explanation: arr[0], arr[1] can be found.
Input: arr[] = [2, 1, 3, 5, 4, 6]
Output: 3
Explanation: arr[1], arr[3], arr[5] can be found.
